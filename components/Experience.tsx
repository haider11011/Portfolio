					We designed and developed a 3D-printed Modular 'Magnetic
					Digital Microfluidics' (MDM) Architecture apt to perform
					point-of-care diagnostics by on-demand customisation for
					various categories of diagnostic assays. Analysed the
					working of the system using MATLAB Histograms. It is

					I learned the art of using several machines, including the
					Lathe, Milling, and Shaper machines. In Addition, I have
					gained a sound knowledge of Unconventional Machining along
					with the CNC machine set-up, coding line and architecture.
					Also, I worked towards improving the efficiency of CNC
					machining by reducing tool wear and increasing the Material
					Removal Rate.

					Lead a team of 35 racing enthusiasts working for a common

					by the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE International
					). I played my part in designing and manufacturing the
					suspension system using tools such as SolidWorks and MATLAB.
					As a captain, I focused on improving team bonding,
					increasing cash flow through sponsorships and enhancing the

					When I left my job amid the pandemic, I had no option but to
					involve myself in my family business. The business was
					making losses, and I had to increase the sales to gain as
					much profit as possible. I interacted with the customers and
					understood the demand of the market. The market needs
					customization in manufacturing certain materials in the
					city. Thus, we started a shutter rip manufacturing plant
					inside the city and started selling customized shutter rip
					where customers can select the color and size of the rip.
